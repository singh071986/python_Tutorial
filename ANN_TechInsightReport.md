Overview
Artificial Neural Networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. They are widely used for pattern recognition, function approximation, and predictive tasks across many domains.

Real-world applications (high level)
Image and video recognition (classification, segmentation)
Natural language processing (text classification, translation)
Time-series forecasting (finance, demand forecasting)
Anomaly detection (fraud detection, monitoring)
Recommendation systems
Predictive maintenance and sensor analytics
See the "Real world applications" link above for concrete examples and case studies.

Benefits (summary)
Ability to learn complex non-linear relationships
Generalization from examples to new data
Scalability with data and compute (deep models)
Automation of feature extraction (with deep architectures)
Refer to the "Benefits of using ANN" link for a deeper discussion.

ANN in Business Intelligence
ANNs can augment BI by improving forecasting accuracy, automating pattern discovery, and enabling predictive scoring.
Useful in customer segmentation, churn prediction, and demand/planning workflows.
See the provided OMICS article for state-of-the-art commentary in BI contexts.

ANN applications for business
Customer analytics and personalization
Sales and demand forecasting
Risk assessment and fraud detection
Process optimization (manufacturing, logistics)
The DZone guide offers a practitioner-oriented view for business adoption.

Suggested next steps
Read the links in the order above to get context, benefits, and business perspective.
Prototype a small model (e.g., Keras/TensorFlow) on a representative dataset from your domain.
Document experiments and evaluation metrics in this repo under /docs or /notebooks.
